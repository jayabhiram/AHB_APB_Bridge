📌 AHB to APB Bridge – Project Description

The AHB to APB Bridge is a digital RTL design project that enables communication between the high-speed AMBA AHB bus and the low-power AMBA APB bus. The bridge acts as an interface that converts AHB transactions into APB-compatible transfers, allowing efficient connectivity between processors and peripheral devices in SoC designs.

🔹 Key Features

✔️ Designed using Verilog/SystemVerilog

✔️ FSM-based control logic for protocol conversion

✔️ Supports AHB read and write transactions

✔️ Handles AHB address and data phases

✔️ APB setup and enable phase generation

✔️ Proper handshake and response generation (HREADY, HRESP)

✔️ Address decoding for peripheral selection

✔️ Synthesizable and modular RTL design

🔹 Verification Highlights

✔️ Verified using SystemVerilog & UVM

✔️ Constrained random stimulus generation

✔️ Functional coverage implementation

✔️ Scoreboard for data integrity checking

✔️ Protocol compliance checking

🔹 Learning Outcomes

Strong understanding of AMBA protocols (AHB & APB)

Bus protocol conversion techniques

FSM-based digital design

UVM testbench architecture

Coverage-driven verification methodology
